Welcome to File Searching!

This Python script does 1 thing, search. 

Point to a directory and then hit the button, you can search for names, parts of names, and file extensions.

You can even copy, move, paste, and delete. 

It does not search for folders. 

Why would you need this? Let's say you are me and have 500 bookmarks on X and then use JDownloader2 to download everything and all the files are in their own folders.

Because it digs down and ignores folders you can easily manage a bunch of files.
